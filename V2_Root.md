QAR-1 is a minimalistic fast-paced multiplayer platformer deathmatch game

V3
=========
This is the version currently in the works. It will feature p2p cross-platform multiplayer, many different maps, gamemodes and weapons, and more!

Unfortunately though, it is not completed/stable enough to play, but you are free to check it's development at the github page

V1
=========
Version 1 is where the development began. It is super-obsolete, and you probably don't want to download it
